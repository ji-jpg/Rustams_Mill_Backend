# Rustam's Mill - Backend

This is the backend API for Rustam's Mill, responsible for managing data, processing business logic, and handling API requests. The backend is built using **Node.js** and **Express.js** to handle all business logic and communicate with the database.

## Features

- RESTful API for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- User authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access.
- API for handling customer and service data.
- Optionally, API documentation using Swagger for better integration and understanding.
- Integration with MongoDB for storing customer and service-related data.
- Ability to handle form submissions, including the collection of names, emails, and messages from users.

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling routes and middleware.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data (optional: MySQL/PostgreSQL).
- **JWT**: For secure user authentication.
- **Mongoose**: For interacting with MongoDB database.
- **Bcrypt**: For hashing passwords and ensuring user data security.
- **Nodemailer**: For sending email notifications.
- **dotenv**: For environment variables management.
